# GDS: How To

### Overview
This Gds is built on a set of classes that allow it to be easily reconfigured
and expanded. 

GDS and GSE common only at socket server (explain relationship)

## Classes

### Distributor

### Templates

### Data Types

### Loaders

### Decoders

### Encoders

### Consumers

## Notes
 - Currently, the models/common directory has command.py, event.py, and
   channel.py. These files must be present in order for the python dictionaries
   to be properly imported. However, they are empty and not used in the GDS. 
   When we switch to XML dictionaries, these can go away.
